## Known Issues

### Current (v2.1.0)

**Minor Issues:**
1. Progress percentage may show 90% when deployment completes (refresh fixes it)
2. Very slow network can cause npm timeout even with 20 minutes
3. First deployment always slower (no Docker layer cache)

**Workarounds:**
1. Refresh page after completion
2. Increase timeout further if needed (config.php)
3. Expected behavior - subsequent builds faster
